## **About**

I was raised in CT, went to college in Boston, and moved to Chicago for grad school. Outside of physics I love to hike, bike, and read.
Here are some of my favorite science related links: 

1. [John J. McCarthy Observatory in New Milford, CT](https://www.mccarthyobservatory.org/astro-photography-science/)
2. [Interactive tool to study ocean and atmosphere](https://earth.nullschool.net)
