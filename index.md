## Hi!

I'm a 3rd year Physics PhD student at the University of Chicago. I work with Prof. Elisabeth Moyer in the Department of Geosciences. 

### Research

I make high-altitude in-situ water vapor measurements in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UT/LS).

Our instrument is the Chicago Water Isotope Spectrometer (ChiWIS), which flies aboard high-altitude research aircraft like the M-55 Geophysica and 
[NASA's WB-57](https://airbornescience.nasa.gov/aircraft/WB-57_-_JSC). I am part of the [Asian Summer Monsoon Chemical and Climate Impact Project (ACCLIP)](https://www2.acom.ucar.edu/acclip), which will have science flights out of Osan Air Base, South Korea in Summer 2022.


### Experience
It's not been a straight shot to atmospheric sciences...my past experience is in:

Experimental particle physics (direct dark matter detection using liquid and solid state detectors), astrophysics (galaxy mergers), astronomy (radio astronomy, X-shaped radio galaxies; optical astronomy, comets and asteroids)
