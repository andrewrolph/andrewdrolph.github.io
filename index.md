## Thanks for visiting my website

I'm a 3rd year Physics PhD student at the University of Chicago. I work with Prof. Elisabeth Moyer in the Department of Geosciences. 

### Research

I make high-altitude in-situ water vapor measurements in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UT/LS).

Our instrument is the Chicago Water Isotope Spectrometer (ChiWIS), which flies aboard high-altitude research aircraft like the M-55 Geophysica and ```markdown 
[NASA's WB-57](https://airbornescience.nasa.gov/aircraft/WB-57_-_JSC) ```.

### Experience
I didn't start in atmospheric sciences, though...my past experience is in:

 Experimental particle physics (direct dark matter detection using liquid and solid state detectors), Astrophysics (galaxy mergers), Astronomy (radio astronomy, X-shaped radio galaxies; optical astronomy, comets and asteroids)
