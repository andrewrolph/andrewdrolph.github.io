## Thanks for visiting my website

I'm a 3rd year Physics PhD student at the University of Chicago. I work in the Department of Geosciences. 

### Research

Our group makes high-altitude in-situ water vapor measurements in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UT/LS).

I didn't start in atmospheric sciences, though...my past experience is in:

1. Astronomy (radio astronomy, X-shaped radio galaxies; optical astronomy, comets and asteroids)
2. Astrophysics (galaxy mergers)
3. Particle physics (direct dark matter detection using liquid and solid state detectors)

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/carlykleinstern/carlykleinstern.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
